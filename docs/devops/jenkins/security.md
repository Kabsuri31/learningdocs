Securing Jenkins is crucial to protect both Jenkins environment and the sensitive data it might be processing. Several security measures can be implemented:

####Enable Global Security: 
In the "Configure Global Security" section of the Manage Jenkins page, select the "Enable security" option. Here, you can select different security realms (methods of authenticating users) and authorization strategies (who can access what).

#####Authentication: 
Managing who can access your Jenkins is the first step. Jenkins supports LDAP, Active Directory, or a custom user database for authentication. Alternatively, the Jenkins own user database can be used, where usernames and hashed passwords are stored on Jenkins master.

####Authorization: 
Once users are authenticated, limit their permissions based on roles. For example, regular developers might only run designated jobs, whereas administrators can manage Jenkins settings. Jenkins has fine-grained permissions available for this purpose. There are also additional plugins like Role-based Authorization Strategy for more advanced authorization setups.

####Secure Passwords: 
Store your passwords and secrets (API keys, SSH keys, etc.) securely. Jenkins provides 'Credential' features to securely store passwords and secret keys.

####Use Security-Enhancing Plugins: 
Consider installing plugins that enhance security. For instance, the OWASP Markup Formatter Plugin (previously known as the "Safe HTML" plugin) can be used to sanitize rich-text inputs.

####Regular Updates: 
Regularly updating Jenkins and plugins help to patch any discovered security vulnerabilities. Jenkins provides warnings for known vulnerable plugins.

####Use HTTPS: 
Configure Jenkins to serve over HTTPS, encrypting traffic between Jenkins and its clients, strengthening the protection against password snooping or hijacking of session cookies.

####Build Parameters Safety: 
Be careful with how build parameters are used, as they may expose sensitive data. Inject sensitive build parameters as environment variables that get masked in the Jenkins console log.

####Access Control: 
Consider limiting the network access to Jenkins, making it reachable only from trusted networks.
